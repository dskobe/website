## IB Primary Years Programme

The [IBO (International Baccalaureate Organisation)](https://www.ibo.org/en/school/002685) is a non-profit organisation based in The Hague, The Netherlands. It provides an educational philosophy and framework to ensure that schools all over the world are providing stimulating, relevant and balanced programmes for their students.

As an authorised IB PYP (International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme) world school since 2006 uses the PYP Programme of Inquiry to create a comprehensive, inquiry based programme from Kindergarten to Grade 6. The resulting programme focuses on delivering a holistic curriculum encompassing the academic, social, emotional and physical aspects of learning.

The learning is organised into six Units of Inquiry based around six organising themes about our world and who we are. Through these units, the classroom teachers integrate language, mathematics, science, personal social education, social studies, drama and ICT, while single-subject teachers integrate music, physical education, German/English language and Japanese language.

## Cambridge Primary

Within our IB framework we use the high quality [Cambridge maths and language programme](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-primary/) for our academic curriculum. Originating from and developed by Cambridge university in the UK, the international Cambridge programme is a very popular curriculum for secondary school and high schools. Building on this, Cambridge university developed the primary programme, to provide a high quality curriculum for young learners. It has academic levels second to none, ensuring that your child will receive the best possible start to life as we integrate the curriculum into our IB inquiry and critical thinking framework.

We assess all of our students three times a year to understand their maths and language levels development needs. For students that then need that extra help, we have specialist maths and language teachers who work with students in small groups or 1-1, ensuring all students are at the right level by the end of the school year.
