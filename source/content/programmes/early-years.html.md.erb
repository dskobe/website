The Early Years Program at DSKI consists of two primary groups: **Pre-Kindergarten (children 2-3 years old)** and **Early Years / Kindergarten (children 3-5 years old)**. The Early Years department is equipped with facilities and resources that were designed with younger children in mind, and created to provide them an accessible and engaging space to flourish.

The Pre-Kindergarten curriculum follows three original units inspired by the IB philosophy of “inquiry-based learning.” These units help children to build vocabulary, strengthen their developing social and motor skills, and prep them for entry into the IB PYP Early Years Program.

Over the course of two years, students in Early Years explore 8 PYP Units of Inquiry, providing them a foundation for the transdisciplinary themes of the PYP. In addition to unit experiences in the classroom, Early Years children embark on a number of exciting excursions throughout the year. Children also enjoy a rich weekly schedule filled with challenging and fun subjects including: Art, Physical Education, German as a Foreign Language, Music, and more!

Teachers aid children as they begin their journeys to become Lifelong Learners, providing a safe and support-filled environment where questions are welcome and play is the most important part of the day.
