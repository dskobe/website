      <p>DSK International has two branches: the German Branch and the International Branch.</p>
      <p>For learners in the International Branch the language of instruction is English, children also have the opportunity to learn Japanese and German. For learners in the German Branch, math and language classes are conducted in German, and all other classes are conducted in English except for the Japanese lessons.</p>
      <p>German and International Branch students enjoy inquiry-based learning together as a whole class to encourage community building.</p>
