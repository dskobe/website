**September 2023 Start**

Dear Parents,

We are now in the process of preparing for the new Saturday School year starting in September, 2023. You can help us by clicking the right link below and filling in the student re-enrollment online form by May 28, 2023.  Re-enrollment of  your child by this date assures your child of a place in our 2023-2024 program.  Re-enrollments after this date will also be accepted and will be confirmed on a basis of class and seat availability.

The re-enrollment for your child for our Saturday school should be done online.  So please click the relevant link for your child and re-enroll at the earliest.
