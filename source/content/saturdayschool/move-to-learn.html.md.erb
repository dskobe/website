**Notes on the program**

* This program is not a language based program BUT a learning based movement and activity program.
* The name of our program says it all, ‘Move to Learn’. This is the name of an Australian based program (copyrighted) that was developed more than 30 years ago by Barbara Pheloung to enhance the learning abilities of children through movement. (If you want to know more about this then please contact Mr. Burton who is the official representative of the Move to Learn company in Japan).
* In addition Mr. Burton will use his very own ACE program (Activity, Communication and Exercise program).which he has developed in Japan.
* It will have an original curriculum created by our Saturday school coordinator Mr. Cecil Burton that includes fun filled movements, activities, music, songs, games, play, arts and crafts, etc.
* It will be conducted primarily in English but Japanese will also be used.
* This is an inclusive program and is open to any child from age 5 to 12 and more importantly children with special needs are not only welcome but encouraged to join this program which will be tremendous benefit to them (conditions would apply).
* There will be one class only for all the children and activities will be arranged according to each child’s abilities, weaknesses and strengths and pace of growth.

**Objectives**

1. Building the cornerstones to a solid learning foundation for students by using their basic skills, abilities and strengths, while also working on improving their weaknesses, through an activity based holistic approach, in a bilingual English/Japanese immersion environment.
2. Our focus during this program is on developing or further enhancing a child’s skills and abilities in learning, thinking, memory, behaviour, communication, gross and fine motor skills, balance and coordination of the brain and body, the body centerline, etc. and challenging them through various fun filled physical and mental activities, rather than just learning a language.
3. The end goal of this program is for any child who joins this program to have more self-confidence, communicate and behave better, and have better skills and abilities in the application, usage and coordination of both their mind and body for learning, then they did when they first entered this program.

**Curriculum**

Would be based on physical and mental activities that could include exercises, ball/card/physical/mental/concentration games, music, songs, dance, art and crafts, speaking, appropriate behavioural training, communication with peers and adults, questions and answers, vocabulary building, reading, writing, comprehension in listening, speaking and individual and group tasks, depending on the level of each child.

**Eligibility**

Any child who is between the ages of 5 ~12 can join. Children without any English ability will also be accepted into this program.

*Special needs children are especially welcome to apply for this program (conditions would apply).*
