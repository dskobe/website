**Some Important English Program Details**

* There are 30 class days in a one year program (Sep. to Jun.); each class day is of three hours duration, starting at 9.00 a.m. and ending at 12.00 p.m.
* Five or more classes are usually set up at different levels each year, so that each student can be in a class with other students similar or close to their level, depending on the total number of students joining the program.
* Children are placed in a level of class, according to their ability, not their age.
* A minimum of six students is required to run any class level. Student and teacher ratios are kept at conducive levels. In the case of a class having a very large number of students, we might at the schoolâ€™s discretion, consider having an assistant teacher also in the class to assist the main class teacher in teaching.
* Homework is usually given to the students at every class, parents are informed about this and are expected to help and support their child in completing this at home (if the child has any difficulties doing it).
* Twice a year a Term Report is prepared for every child assessing their strengths, growth, levels and performance during that period.
* Children who continue the program over the next year, are assessed at the end of the year, as to their suitability in moving up to the next level or staying in the same level for another year, depending on their progress.
