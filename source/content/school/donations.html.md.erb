We appreciate your continued support of the educational and research activities of the Deutsche Schule Kobe International School (DSKI).

The school will celebrate its 115th anniversary in 2025. We remain committed to providing an exceptional education, we foster international mindedness, critical thinking, inclusion and respect for diversity and the willingness to act with integrity and compassion.

On the other hand, in order to adapt to the recent changes in society, such as the declining birthrate, progress of an advanced information technology, and rising prices, our school is required to establish a strong financial base and strengthen its administrative and operational structure to make our operations sound.

We will continue our efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency, and with the financial support of a wide range of people both inside and outside the school, we have decided to make this donation in order to achieve further development.

We sincerely appreciate your understanding of the purpose of our request for donations and would like to ask for your support and cooperation.
