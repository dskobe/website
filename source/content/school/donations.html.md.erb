Dear parents of DSKI,

As the school celebrates its 115th anniversary, we remain committed to providing an exceptional education, fostering international mindedness, critical thinking, inclusion and respect for diversity as well as the willingness to act with integrity and compassion.

We have many ideas on how to upgrade our classrooms and school grounds to achieve a wonderful learning environment for our children and school community. In order to achieve our goals faster, we would like to appeal to your generosity and humbly ask you to consider donating towards our cause.

We have recently become an “Institution of Public Interest”, which allows us to legally issue donation receipts. These can be used to lower your taxable income and therefore your income tax rate.

Please help us build a strong community through your donation. <br>
Contact our office for more informations.

Yours sincerely,

Lars Heuseler <br>
Chair of the School Board
