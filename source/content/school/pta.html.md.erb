# Parent Teacher Association

The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) consists of the parent and the teacher representatives from each of the primary school and Early Years / Kindergarten classes who are elected as representatives.

They meet every month with some of our staff to help plan and organize school events and activities.

They also arrange events for parents to get together and socialize. It's a great way to get involved with school life, meet new people and make new friends!

To contact us, please send an email to [pta@dskobe.org](mailto:pta@dskobe.org).
