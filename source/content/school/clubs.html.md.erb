**After School**

DSK International offers a wide range of after school extracurricular club activities. From sports to arts, to cooking and much more we feel there is something for everyone!

**Before School**

In addition to our after school club activities, we are now pleased to announce that we will have two active morning clubs  for those early risers who just can’t wait to get a move on and start their day!

**For Adults Too**

The clubs and classes aren’t only for the kids! Our list of adult classes and clubs is steadily growing!

If all that wasn’t enough, our clubs are also open for external children to attend.

<i>*Please note an (*) indicates that the club runs for 90 minutes every second week when possible. Due to holidays and or dates of field trips it's not always possible to hold the club every two weeks. However, we have spaced them out as best as possible.</i>

If you want to join simply fill in the <%= link_to 'Online Application Form', current_page.data.media.signup %> and book your place. If we reach the minimum participant number required for the clubs, we will run them.

Standard Club Fee is ¥20000, with the exception of the Skateboard (¥23000 - includes G Skatepark entrance fee) and Baking and Cooking Clubs (¥21000 - covers the cost of ingredients).

If you join before the first 7 lessons are over the fee is ¥20000.

If there are 7 or fewer club dates left, then the fee will be ¥10000.

### Schedule and Transport

Students will be supervised in the school lunchroom while having a snack between the end of classes at 3:30 and the start of the club activity at 15:45. Most clubs finish between 16:30 and 16:45, with the exception of the Skateboard, Cooking and Baking Clubs which will end at 17:15 as they are only offered every second week. There will be no buses at this time to transport your child home, so try to carpool with other parents.
