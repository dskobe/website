In keeping with our commitment to 21st Century Learning and ICT (Information Communication Technology) skills development the school has invested in a range of new multimedia technologies and hardware to support these goals. These skills, concepts and competences will be embedded in the Units of Inquiry to enhance learning and presentation opportunities. Hand in hand with these practical skills will be an appropriate Digital Literacy and Citizenship curriculum to explicitly teach the students about Internet safety, security and the issues related to the use of Social Media Technologies. Parents are actively encouraged to enter into a learning environment with their kids. Currently there are class computers in every room. These computers are Macs and offer excellent graphic editing and video-making options for the students.

## Laptops

Further to this development the school has two Mobile Laptop carts that can be booked out daily to enhance research, presentation and digital literacy skills. The laptops have a Windows 8 operating system and serve the students in three languages, English, German and Japanese.

The quality of the pictures/video and the excellent speakers combine to make a thrilling and dramatic presentation of multimedia of all types.
