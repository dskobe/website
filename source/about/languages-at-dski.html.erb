<h1>One Student - Three Languages</h1>
<p>Language is vital to our identity and thereby shapes the way we act and interact. It is used as a tool to communicate feelings, ideas and experiences with other people. People use language to develop an understanding of the world and to construct meaning. It is key to development at social, emotional and cognitive levels and therefore all pupils regardless of their origin are language learners and all teachers, regardless of their specialty, are language teachers. </p>
<p>Within our curriculum and school life language is a medium of inquiry and is central to children’s intellectual and emotional development. Children develop language as they develop thought, and they develop thought as they develop language. The three languages used at DSKI are English, German and Japanese. </p>

<h2 class="mt-5">Where does my child fit in?</h2>
<p>The two main branches are German and International (English language). Though learners spend most of their day together in an integrated classroom with both English and German-speaking homeroom teachers, math and language instruction occurs in either German or English.</p>
<p>Your child will be placed into either the German branch or the International branch. The German branch is usually for native German speakers or for parents who would like their child to have core subjects in German (maths and German language classes).</p>
<p>The International (English) branch is for parents who would like all of their child's lessons to be in English. Please note all students also take compulsory Japanese lessons taught either as JFL (Japanese as a foreign language) or as KOKUGO (Japanese as a native language). All students in the International branch also have two German lessons a week.</p>
<p>Please see below for more information about the branches and how Japanese fits into the curriculum.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p class="lead">Q: Because of the German history I thought it was for Germans or people with German family?</p>
    <p>A: No, DSKI is for everyone, not only for German students or students with German family. We have a German school history but now we are full International School with most of the day being spent in English. If you are looking for an International School we would love to hear from you!</p>
