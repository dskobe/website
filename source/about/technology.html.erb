<p>In keeping with our commitment to 21st Century Learning and ICT (Information Communication Technology) skills development the school has invested in a range of new multimedia technologies and hardware to support these goals. These skills, concepts and competences will be embedded in the Units of Inquiry to enhance learning and presentation opportunities. Hand in hand with these practical skills will be an appropriate Digital Literacy and Citizenship curriculum to explicitly teach the students about Internet safety, security and the issues related to the use of Social Media Technologies. Parents are actively encouraged to enter into a learning environment with their kids. Currently there are class computers in every room. These computers are Macâ€™s and offer excellent graphic editing and video-making options for the students.</p>
