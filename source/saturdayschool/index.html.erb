<p>Saturday school at DSK International is a Saturday morning school open to children with English, German or French speaking backgrounds from the ages of 5 years to 12 years.</p>
<p>There are three regular programmes: <%= link_to 'English', local_path('saturdayschool/english-program'), class: 'font-weight-bold' %>, <%= link_to 'German', local_path('saturdayschool/german-program'), class: 'font-weight-bold' %> and <%= link_to 'French', local_path('saturdayschool/french-program'), class: 'font-weight-bold' %> (Language Based Programs) and one learning and movement based programme: <%= link_to 'Move to Learn', local_path('saturdayschool/move-to-learn'), class: 'font-weight-bold' %>. The 2018 – 2019 year programs start in September 2018. Applications are mainly open from February to June but are also accepted during other months of the year.</p>
<p>We offer unique and educational learning programs not only in English, but in three languages: English, German and French all under one roof. Our teachers in each program are native or basically native, experienced, qualified and or professional language teachers.</p>
<p>Our English, German and French programs are designed to primarily meet the demand from parents who desire a comprehensive language based growth program for their children. The program is structured to the specific needs of bilingual/trilingual children so as to help the children enhance or master their skills in the chosen language.</p>
<p>The school year consists of 30 weeks (30 class days) divided into 2 terms of 15 class days each. Lessons are based on a school proven curriculum designed according to the students’ year level and competency.</p>
<p>We hope to provide an opportunity not only to the children but also to the parents to become a part of the foreign community with their child joining our Saturday School.</p>
