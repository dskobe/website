  dream: "I'm not sure yet, but I do want to go to college to learn more about archeology."
  message: "What would you like to tell people about DSKI?</strong><br>It is a really great school. Since it is small you always have to be around the same people, and people that you might not like. But you get chances to become friends with the people you don't like. I can say with confidence that the 6 years I spent at DSKI was amazing, and that I would recommend this school to everyone who is interested."

  activities: "I used to be a part of the chorus club throughout junior high school and high school. In general, though, I enjoy any type of crafting, especially making mini albums."
  dream: "Attend a university in Ottawa, Canada."
  message: "What would you like to tell people about DSKI?</strong><br>DSKI is such an inspirational school to learn in. I have so much to say, but what I would like to emphasize the most is how the teachers support children to be independent learners through a class called the unit of inquiry. The significance of this teaching style is that children are very motivated and excited to learn, develop knowledge, come up with ideas and seek for solutions. I find this unique to this school and feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to spend time in this school with amazing teachers and friends. Oh, and I absolutely love the colourful classrooms with plenty of art and visual aids not only on the walls but also hanging down from the ceilings!!"

  message: "What would you like to tell people about DSKI?</strong><br>Deutsche Schule/European School always made me feel like I was at home, and all my friends and everyone in school were like my family. It was a very comfortable place to be, and I was always excited to go to school. Also, because it is a small school, I was able to ask questions to my teachers easily which helped me learn a lot. The school allowed me to experience a lot of different things such as going on the 4 nights, 5 days trips to Green Echo and events such as Christmas Market in Osaka where I had the chance to perform in front of a large audience. Overall Deutsche Schule Kobe/European School was a place where I created lots of fun memories with the best people."
